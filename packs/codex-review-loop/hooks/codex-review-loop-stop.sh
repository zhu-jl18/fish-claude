  # ── Preamble ──
  cat << PREAMBLE_EOF
You are orchestrating a thorough, independent code review of recent changes in this repository.

Use multi-agent to run the following review agents IN PARALLEL. Each agent should return its findings as structured text (not write to files). After ALL agents complete, consolidate their findings into a single deduplicated review file.

IMPORTANT: Spawn one agent per review path below. Wait for all agents to finish. Then deduplicate overlapping findings and write the consolidated review to: ${REVIEW_FILE}

  # ── Agent 1: Diff Review ──
  cat << 'DIFF_EOF'

AGENT 1: Diff Review (focus on uncommitted and recently committed changes ONLY)

Run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to see all uncommitted changes. Also run `git log --oneline -5` and `git diff HEAD~5` for recently committed work. Focus your review EXCLUSIVELY on this changed code.

Review criteria for changed code:

Code Quality:
- Is the changed code well-organized, modular, and readable?
- Does it follow DRY principles — no copy-pasted blocks that should be abstracted?
- Are names (variables, functions, files) clear and consistent with the codebase?
- Are abstractions at the right level — not over-engineered, not under-abstracted?
- Is there unnecessary complexity that could be simplified?

Test Coverage:
- Does every new function/endpoint/component have corresponding tests?
- Are edge cases covered: empty inputs, nulls, boundary values, error paths?
- Are tests isolated, deterministic, and fast?
- Do tests verify behavior (not implementation details)?
- For bug fixes: is there a regression test that would have caught the original bug?

Security:
- Input validation: are all user inputs validated and sanitized before use?
- Authentication/authorization: are auth checks present on all protected routes/actions?
- Injection: any risk of SQL injection, XSS, command injection, path traversal?
- Secrets: are any credentials, API keys, or tokens hardcoded or logged?
- OWASP Top 10: check for broken access control, cryptographic failures, insecure design, security misconfiguration, vulnerable dependencies, SSRF
- Are error messages safe (no stack traces or internal details leaked to users)?

For each issue: return file path, line number, severity (critical/high/medium/low), category, description, and suggested fix.

AGENT 2: Holistic Review (evaluate overall project structure and agent readiness)

Read the full project directory structure, key config files, README, and any AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md files. This is NOT about individual line changes — it's about whether the project is well-structured for maintainability and agent-driven development.

Review criteria for the whole project:

Code Organization & Modularity:
- Is the project structure logical and navigable? Can a new developer (or agent) find things?
- Are concerns properly separated (data access, business logic, presentation, config)?
- Are there god files/functions that do too much and should be split?
- Is shared code properly extracted into reusable modules?
- Are import paths clean (absolute imports, no deep relative paths)?

Documentation & Agent Harness:
- Does every major directory have an AGENTS.md with operating guidelines for agents?
- Is there a CLAUDE.md symlinked to each AGENTS.md for Claude Code compatibility?
- Do AGENTS.md files document: conventions, file purposes, testing patterns, common pitfalls?
- Is there telemetry/observability instrumentation (logging, metrics, tracing)?
- Is there a type system in use (TypeScript, Python type hints, etc.) with proper coverage?
- Are there proper constraints and guardrails so agents working on the code are set up for success?
- Are environment variables documented and validated at startup?
- Are there clear boundaries between server-only and client-safe code?

Architecture:
- Is the dependency graph clean (no circular dependencies)?
- Are external integrations properly abstracted behind interfaces?
- Is configuration centralized rather than scattered?
- Is error handling consistent across the codebase?

For each issue: return file path (or directory), severity (critical/high/medium/low), category, description, and suggested fix.

AGENT 3: Next.js & React Best Practices Review

This is a Next.js project. Review the codebase against these specific patterns:

App Router & Server Components:
- Are Server Components used by default? Is 'use client' only added when interactivity is needed?
- Is data fetched in Server Components, not Client Components?
- Are Suspense boundaries used for streaming slow data sources?
- Are file conventions correct: layout.tsx, page.tsx, loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx?
- Are searchParams and params handled as Promises (await searchParams / await params)?
- Is generateStaticParams() used to pre-render known dynamic routes?
- Is generateMetadata() used for SEO-critical pages?
- Is notFound() called for missing resources instead of returning null?

Data Fetching & Caching:
- Are parallel data fetches used (Promise.all) instead of sequential waterfalls?
- Is cache strategy appropriate: no-store for fresh data, force-cache for static, revalidate for ISR?
- Are cache tags used for fine-grained invalidation after mutations?
- Is React.cache() used to deduplicate queries within a single request?

Server Actions & Mutations:
- Are Server Actions validated and auth-checked as if they were public API endpoints?
- Is revalidateTag/revalidatePath called after mutations to invalidate cache?
- Is after() used for non-blocking post-response work (logging, analytics)?

Performance & Bundle Size:
- No barrel file imports — import directly from source paths?
- Is next/dynamic with { ssr: false } used for heavy client-only components?
- Are non-critical libraries (analytics, error tracking) deferred until after hydration?
- Are heavy bundles preloaded on user intent (hover/focus)?
- Is data minimized across the RSC boundary (only pass fields client needs)?

React Performance:
- Is derived state calculated during render, not in effects?
- Are expensive computations memoized appropriately?
- Is useTransition used for non-urgent updates?
- No unnecessary useEffect for things that belong in event handlers?
- Are stable callback references used (functional setState, refs) to avoid re-render churn?
- Is content-visibility: auto used for long lists?
- Are inline scripts used to set client data before hydration (prevent FOUC)?

For each issue: return file path, line number, severity (critical/high/medium/low), category, description, and suggested fix.

AGENT (UX): Browser-Based UX Review (SKIP if you cannot access a running dev server)

If the project has a running dev server, use agent-browser to test the UI.
Install agent-browser if needed: npm install -g agent-browser (or: brew install agent-browser)

Testing checklist:
- Navigate to all major routes/pages
- Test key user workflows end-to-end (signup, login, CRUD operations, etc.)
- Take screenshots at desktop (1280x720) and mobile (375x812) viewports
- Check for: broken layouts, missing error states, loading states, empty states
- Verify accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus indicators, color contrast
- Check responsive design at multiple breakpoints
- Verify forms have proper validation feedback
- Check that error messages are user-friendly

If the dev server is not running or you cannot access it, skip this agent and note that UX testing was not performed.

For each issue: return screenshot description, severity, category, description, and suggested fix.

  # ── Consolidation instructions ──
  cat << CONSOLIDATION_EOF

CONSOLIDATION INSTRUCTIONS (after all agents complete):

1. Collect all findings from all agents
2. Deduplicate: if multiple agents flagged the same issue, keep the most detailed version
3. Organize all findings by severity (critical first, then high, medium, low)
4. For each finding, include:
   - File path and line number (or directory for structural issues)
   - Severity: critical / high / medium / low
   - Category: which review path found it (Diff, Holistic, Next.js, UX)
   - Description: clear explanation
   - Suggested fix: concrete, actionable recommendation
5. End with a summary: total issues, breakdown by severity, agents that ran, overall assessment
6. Write the COMPLETE consolidated review to: ${REVIEW_FILE}

IMPORTANT: You MUST create the file ${REVIEW_FILE} with the full review.
